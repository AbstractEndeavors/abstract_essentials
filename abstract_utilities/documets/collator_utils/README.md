The `collator_utils.py` script provides utility functions for generating and manipulating alphanumeric lists. 

Below is a brief overview of each function within this script:

1. `get_alpha_list()`: This function generates a list of all lowercase alphabets. It returns this list.

2. `get_num_list()`: This function generates a list of digits (0 to 9) as strings. It returns this list.

3. `find_it_alph(ls: list, y: any)`: This function is used to find the index of an element in a list. It takes a list (`ls`) and an element (`y`) as inputs, and returns the index of the element within the list. If the element is not found, it returns -1.

4. `get_alpha(k: int|float)`: This function retrieves the alphabetic character corresponding to the given index. It takes an integer or float `k` as an input, representing the index of the character, and returns the corresponding alphabetic character. This function makes use of the `get_multiply_remainder` function from `math_utils.py` to handle situations where the index exceeds the length of the alphabet. If the index is a multiple of the alphabet length, it returns a character sequence.

The utility functions in this script could be used for various alphanumeric manipulations, including but not limited to, generating custom alphanumeric sequences, mapping numerical values to alphabets, and searching for elements within a list.
