Defaults to 'application/json'.\\n    api_env (str): The name of the environment variable containing the API key. Defaults to 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.\\n    api_key (str): The API key for OpenAI. If not provided, it is retrieved using the `get_openai_key` method.\\n    header (dict): The headers to be used in the requests.
