defaultdict:
defaultdict(default_factory=None, /, [...]) --> dict with default factory

The default factory is called without arguments to produce
a new value when a key is not present, in __getitem__ only.
A defaultdict compares equal to a dict with the same items.
All remaining arguments are treated the same as if they were
passed to the dict constructor, including keyword arguments.
