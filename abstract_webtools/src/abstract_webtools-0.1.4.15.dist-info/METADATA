```
## Description

The `abstract_webtools` module, part of the `abstract_essentials` package, provides various utilities and functionalities for web scraping and web request handling. This includes functions to retrieve and check the status of URLs, clean and format URLs, fetch source code with custom user agents, and more.

## Classes

1. **TLSAdapter(HTTPAdapter)**  
   A custom HTTPAdapter class that configures TLS/SSL options and ciphers.

## Dependencies

This module relies on the following external libraries:

- `requests`
- `ssl`
- `urllib`
- `BeautifulSoup`

## Usage

### Get Status Code

The `get_status` function fetches the status code of the URL.

```python
from abstract_webtools import clean_url

urls = clean_url('https://example.com')
print(urls)  # Output: ['https://example.com', 'http://example.com']
tps://example.com'
```

### Try Request

The `try_request` function makes HTTP requests to a URL and returns the response if successful.

```python
from abstract_webtools import try_request

response = try_request('https://www.example.com')
print(response)  # Output: <Response [200]>
```

### Is Valid URL

The `is_valid` function checks whether a given URL is valid.

```python
from abstract_webtools import is_valid

valid = is_valid('https://www.example.com')
print(valid)  # Output: True
```

### Get Source Code

The `get_Source_code` function fetches the source code of a URL with a custom user-agent.

```python
from abstract_webtools import get_Source_code

source_code = get_Source_code('https://www.example.com')
print(source_code)  # Output: HTML source code of the URL
```

### Parse React Source

The `parse_react_source` function fetches the source code of a URL and extracts JavaScript and JSX source code (React components).

```python
from abstract_webtools import parse_react_source

react_code = parse_react_source('https://www.example.com')
print(react_code)  # Output: List of JavaScript and JSX source code found in <script> tags
```

### Get All Website Links

The `get_all_website_links` function returns all URLs found on a specified URL that belong to the same website.

```python
from abstract_webtools import get_all_website_links

links = get_all_website_links('https://www.example.com')
print(links)  # Output: List of URLs belonging to the same website as the specified URL
```

### Parse All

The `parse_all` function fetches the source code of a URL and extracts information about HTML elements, attribute values, attribute names, and class names.

```python
from abstract_webtools import parse_all

HTML_components = parse_all('https://www.example.com')
print(HTML_components["element_types"])       # Output: List of HTML element types
print(HTML_components["attribute_values"])    # Output: List of attribute values
print(HTML_components["attribute_names"])     # Output: List of attribute names
print(HTML_components["class_names"])         # Output: List of class names
```

### Extract Elements

The `extract_elements` function fetches the source code of a URL and extracts portions of the source code based on provided filters.

```python
from abstract_webtools import extract_elements

elements = extract_elements('https://www.example.com', element_type='div', attribute_name='class', class_name='container')
print(elements)  # Output: List of HTML elements that match the provided filters
```
