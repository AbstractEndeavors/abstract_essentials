# Python Module Upload to PyPI

This utility script allows you to easily upload your Python module to the Python Package Index (PyPI) using Twine. It automates several steps of the packaging and distribution process, making it easier to share your module with the Python community.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- `twine`, `build`,`abstract_utilities`,`abstract_gui` and `pexpect` packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:

  ```bash
  pip install twine build pexpect
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (`upload_to_pypi.py`) to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the directory where your Python module is located using the command line.

3. **Optional**: If you use a virtual environment, activate it before proceeding.

## Usage

Run the script `upload_to_pypi.py` with Python 3:

```bash
python3 upload_to_pypi.py
```

The script will guide you through the following steps:

1. **Selecting Module Directory**: You will be prompted to pick the module directory using a GUI window. This directory should contain the necessary files, including the `setup.py` file.

2. **Updating Version Number**: If the version number in the `setup.py` file matches an existing version in the `dist` directory, you will be asked to enter a new version number.

3. **Building the Module**: The script will build your module using the `setup.py` script. The distribution files (wheels) will be placed in the `dist` directory.

4. **Uploading to PyPI**: The script will prompt you to enter your PyPI username and password securely. It will then upload the module to PyPI using Twine.

5. **Installing the Module**: After successful upload, you will have the option to install the module using pip for testing purposes.
