To install the necessary packages for the Python code you've provided, you'll need to use `pip`, which is the standard package manager for Python. Below are the commands to install each required package. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system before running these commands.

1. **pyperclip** - for clipboard operations:
   ```bash
   pip install pyperclip
   ```

2. **numpy** - for numerical operations and arrays:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. **opencv-python (cv2)** - for image processing:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

4. **Pillow (PIL)** - for image manipulation:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

5. **pyscreenshot** - for capturing screen images:
   ```bash
   pip install pyscreenshot
   ```

6. **pytesseract** - Python wrapper for Tesseract OCR:
   ```bash
   pip install pytesseract
   ```

7. **matplotlib** - for plotting and visualization:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

For the commented-out `pyautogui` and the `python_imagesearch.imagesearch` modules, if you decide to use them:

8. **pyautogui** - for GUI automation tasks:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui
   ```

9. **python-imagesearch** - for image search functionality (not a standard package, so you need to ensure the repository is still active):
   ```bash
   pip install python-imagesearch
   ```

Regarding `abstract_utilities`, it seems like a custom module and not something available via `pip`. If it's a custom package or module you have created or obtained from a specific source, you'll need to ensure it's correctly installed or available in your Python environment's `sys.path`.

For Tesseract OCR, as mentioned in a previous response, you need to install it separately as it's not a Python package. The installation method depends on your operating system. For Linux, you typically use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

For Windows, you have to download and install it from the Tesseract GitHub page and ensure the path to `tesseract.exe` is correctly set in your Python script or added to the system's PATH environment variable.

Make sure to run these commands in your command line or terminal. Depending on your Python setup, you might need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`. Also, if you're using a virtual environment (which is a good practice), make sure you've activated it before running these commands.
