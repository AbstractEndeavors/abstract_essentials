Description
===========

SoundVolumeCommandLine (svcl.exe) is a console application that allows
you to do many actions related to sound volume from command-line,
including - set sound volume of devices and applications, mute/unmute
devices and applications, increase/decrease volume of devices and
applications, set the volume level of specific channel, set the default
render/capture device, get the current sound volume level of specific
device, and more...

svcl.exe is the console version of the SoundVolumeView tool, and you can
use all commands of SoundVolumeView in svcl.exe, with exactly the same
syntax. If you want to learn how the use the commands of this tool,
simply go to the 'Command-Line Options' section in the SoundVolumeView
Web page.

There is also a new command, /Stdout , available only in svcl.exe, which
sends information related to the executed command to stdout (see below).

This utility works on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 2008,
Windows 10, and Windows 11. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.

Versions History
================


* Version 1.20:
  o Added /SaveDeviceFormat and /LoadDeviceFormat command-line
    options, which allows you to save the data of the device default
    format into a file, and then later load it back into the device.
  o You should use these new commands if you have a format that
    cannot be set with the /SetDefaultFormat command.

* Version 1.15:
  o Added /SetSpeakersConfig command-line option, which allows you to
    set the desired speakers configuration (Stereo, Quadraphonic, 5.1
    Surround, 7.1 Surround) from command-line.
  o Added /Columns command-line option, which allows you to set the
    columns to display or the columns to export from command-line, for
    example:
    SoundVolumeCommandLine.exe /scomma "c:\temp\sound-items.csv" /Columns
    "Name,Command-Line Friendly ID,Volume Percent"

* Version 1.10:
  o You can now use wildcard with the command-line friendly ID, for
    example:
    SoundVolumeCommandLine.exe /Switch "Realtek*\Device\Speakers\Render"
  o You can now specify the number of channels in the
    /SetDefaultFormat command, for example:
    SoundVolumeCommandLine.exe /SetDefaultFormat "Speakers" 24 48000 4

* Version 1.05:
  o Updated the /SetAppDefault and /SetSpatial commands to work on
    Windows 11.
  o You can now use any variable inside the .cfg file of
    SoundVolumeView tool (SoundVolumeView.cfg) in order to set the
    configuration from command line, for example:
    SoundVolumeCommandLine.exe /SaveFileEncoding 3 /ShowUnpluggedDevices
    1 /ShowDisabledDevices 1

* Version 1.00 - First release.



The /Stdout command-line option
===============================

By default, when you use a command to get the current sound volume or
mute state, the value is returned through the return code of the .exe
file and you can get it with the %errorlevel% variable, for example:
svcl.exe /GetPercent "Realtek High Definition
Audio\Device\Speakers\Render"
echo %errorlevel%

With svcl.exe, there is another option, you can add the /Stdout command,
and then the value will be send to stdout and it'll be displayed inside
your command prompt window, for example:
svcl.exe /Stdout /GetPercent "Realtek High Definition
Audio\Device\Speakers\Render"

If you add the /Stdout command to a set command ( /SetVolume, /SetDefault
, /Mute , /ChangeVolume , and others....) , the list of the found sound
items will be sent to Stdout, so you can see which sound items are
affected by the executed command.
