Certainly! Here is the comprehensive README for the 'abstract_audio' module:

# Abstract Audio

The 'abstract_audio' module provides functionalities to capture and manipulate audio input from a microphone and save it into a text file. It also includes an abstract GUI to display the state of audio recording and playback.

## Installation

You can install the module using pip:

```bash
pip install abstract_audio
```

## Usage


### Speech-to-Text Application

The 'speech_to_text_gui.py' script provides a simple speech-to-text application with a graphical user interface (GUI). The application uses the SpeechRecognition library to perform speech recognition and PySimpleGUI for GUI implementation. It allows you to record your voice, transcribe the audio to text, and save it in a file called 'voice.txt'.

To use the speech-to-text application, run the following command:

```bash
python speech_to_text_gui.py
```

The GUI window will open, displaying a 'record' button. Click on the 'record' button to start recording your voice. The GUI screen will turn green to indicate that it is recording. Once you stop speaking, the recorded audio will be processed using the Google Web Speech API, and the recognized text will be displayed in the GUI window.

### Volume Commands

The 'volume_commands.py' module provides a set of volume control commands for Windows operating systems. It allows you to control the system's volume, mute, and unmute the system, check the current volume, and change the volume incrementally.

To use the volume commands, import the 'volume_commands' object from the 'volume_commands.py' module:

```python
from abstract_audio.volume_states.volume_commands import volume_commands
```

Then, you can use the methods provided by the 'volume_commands' object to control the system's volume:

```python
# Check the current volume
current_volume = volume_commands.check_volume()
print("Current Volume:", current_volume)

# Set the volume to a specific value
volume_commands.set_volume(50)  # Sets the volume to 50%

# Change the volume incrementally
volume_commands.change_volume(10)  # Increases the volume by 10%
```

Note: The volume control commands are currently supported only on Windows operating systems.

## Source Code Map
